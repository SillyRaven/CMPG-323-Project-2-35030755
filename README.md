As far as I know/understand only things needed to run the app is either by running it in visual studio's run option and then navigating via the swagger tools or run it through azure's manager also by testing and going through their navigation tools

IP addresses shouldn't be an issue since a wide range of ips were added to the access management section.
Access was also given to all known and needed personel



















Made 4 different repo's since I made mistakes on my pathing in visual studio and had inproper management of pathing so lost a lot of tracking hours based on the fact of recreating repo's and finding issues again. (I couldn't figure out how to fix the context to find new zones between my branches) 
Sorry for the inconvenience of improper hour tracking and young repository
